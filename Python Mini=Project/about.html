    <h2>About Club Cafe</h2>

    <div class="card">
        <p>
    Club Cafe began with a simple vision — to create a space where people can
    slow down, enjoy good food, and feel genuinely welcome. What started as a
    small idea has grown into a café loved for its handcrafted cakes and warm
    ambience.
</p>

<p>
    Every cake at Club Cafe is prepared using carefully selected ingredients
    and time-tested recipes. From classic favorites to modern dessert creations,
    our focus has always been on quality, freshness, and taste.
</p>

<p>
    We believe a café is more than just food — it's about the experience.
    Whether you are celebrating a special moment, catching up with friends,
    or simply enjoying a quiet coffee, Club Cafe is designed to feel like home.
</p>

<p>
    Our team is passionate about baking and hospitality. Attention to detail,
    consistent quality, and customer satisfaction are values that guide us
    every single day.
</p>

<p>
    As we continue to grow, our promise remains the same — to serve desserts
    that bring joy, comfort, and a little sweetness to everyday life.
